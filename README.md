# aichallenge2
We participated in the JSAE Automotive AIChallenge-2023 and this is our repo for the same competition. 
This competition consisted of 3 tasks where the first one was obstacle detection stop, here the ego(golf cart) has to detect the obstacle(a cardboard) and stop and move only when the obstacle moves out of the drivable area. 
Task 2 consisted of driving in the presence of smoke that is the ego must not stop even in the presence of smoke and continue with its motion.
The third task consisted of navigating through the obstacles and navigating through the turns in a safe and appropriate manner. We completed this challenge with a score of 130.86
Our team was able to get Global Rank 8th in the studnet category.
